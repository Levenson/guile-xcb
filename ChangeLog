	* Version 1.0 released: Here are the highlights; see the git log for details

	* Asynchronous event loop: The inadequate loop based on promises
	was replaced with a more robust one based on delimited continuations

	* Syntax overhaul: symbols exported by the compiled XML files are
	now in the standard Scheme format (lowercase, dash-separated).

	* Transparent string handling: Clients can pass in/read out
	strings from X requests and replies without having to manually
	convert them to/from XCB types.

	* Optional keyword arguments: X request procedures that have
	valueparam arguments specify them with familiar keyword arguments
	and do not need to specify which enum to use for the value name
	list

	* Thread-safe Connections (Partially): Multiple threads can now
	send requests on the same XCB connection without causing race
	conditions. Each reply, event, and error will still be consumed by
	the first thread that polls for it, however.

	* send-event made easy: Added xcb-event->vector to easily convert
	events to the right format for send-event requests

	* Bug fixes, updates test cases, updated manual, and more.
